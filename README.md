# Raffle Selection

This script randomly selects *n* number of records in a pandas dataframe and removes them for in future iterations for raffling prizes.

Libraries imported are pandas for dataframe operations and tkinter for a graphical user interface.  To create an isolated environment for this, run `conda env create -f requirements.yml` in this directory.
